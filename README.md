About: 

We wanted to create a platform combining social media interaction with fashion technology. 
The idea of DripCheck emerged from our love for expressing individuality through style and sharing it with friends, while also exploring how AI can enhance fashion insights.

What it does:

DripCheck features a camera interface, similar to Snapchat, allowing users to capture moments. 
Swiping right brings users to the “Stories” section, where they can view photos shared by their friends. 
Swiping left leads to the “Gallery”, where users can browse their own saved photos. 
After taking a picture, DripCheck runs an AI-powered analysis of the outfit, providing instant feedback and insights about the fit, trends, and style breakdown.

How we built it:

DripCheck was built using a combination of front-end, back-end, and AI Vision Processing interfaces. 
We developed the camera and gallery interfaces using Swift IOS Development, XCode. 
The backend infrastructure was powered by Swift as well and was created to be integrated with a machine-learning model built with TensorFlow for outfit analysis. 

Challenges we ran into:

One of the biggest challenges was training the machine learning model to accurately identify different clothing items and evaluate styles. 
We had to collect a substantial dataset and fine-tune our model to recognize various types of fashion trends. 
Although we made significant progress in training the Neural Network, we ultimately decided to pivot to using OpenAI vision processing. 
Given more time and resources, we would continue to build out machine learning to increase the specificity of the app and gear it towards more fashion-forward trends. 

What's next for DripCheck:

Looking forward, we plan to enhance DripCheck by introducing more advanced outfit recommendations and trend analysis. 
We aim to incorporate personalized style suggestions based on user preferences and previous analyses. 
Additionally, expanding the social features to include direct interactions, such as fashion polls and collaborative galleries, is on our roadmap. 
Further improvements to the AI model for greater accuracy and diversity in fashion recognition are also in the works.
